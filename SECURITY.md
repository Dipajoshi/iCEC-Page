## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability in this project, please follow the steps below:

1. **Identify the Vulnerability**: Clearly outline the details of the vulnerability, including how it can be reproduced, potential impact, and any evidence or proof of concept.

2. **Contact Information**: Send your report to [bhattsammar04@gmail.com](mailto:bhattsammar04.com). Alternatively, you may open an issue on the project's GitHub repository, but please note that this may not be the most secure method for sensitive information.

3. **Response Time**: You can expect an acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours. After that, we will assess the vulnerability and prioritize it according to its severity.

4. **Updates**: We aim to provide updates on the status of the reported vulnerability every week until it is resolved or we have determined that no action is required.

5. **Acceptance or Decline**: If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work on a fix and provide details about the patch in the next release. If it is declined, we will inform you of the reasons for this decision.

6. **Confidentiality**: All reports will be treated confidentially and will not be disclosed publicly until the issue has been resolved.

Thank you for helping us maintain the security of our project!
