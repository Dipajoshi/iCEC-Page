   Alternative Login Options:Offer social login options (e.g., "Log in with Google" or "Log in with Facebook") for users who prefer to sign in using third-party services.
   Link to Signup Page: Add a "Don't have an account? Sign up" link to guide new users to the signup page.

   3. Club-Specific Posts Page Design
   Dynamic Content Loading: Display posts specific to the club the user is viewing. Fetch posts dynamically based on the club ID or name.
   Header: Include the club's name, logo, or cover image at the top of the page for context.
   Post Feed Layout: Use a card-based layout to display individual posts, including a title, content preview, author's name, and timestamp. You can also include images or other media related to the post.
   Filter or Sort Options: Provide options to filter posts by category or sort them by date, popularity, etc.
   Add New Post Button (if applicable): Allow authorized users (e.g., club members or admins) to add new posts. Place this button prominently at the top or bottom of the page.
   Comments Section: Enable comments for each post to encourage interaction, if needed.
   Sidebar (Optional): Include a sidebar with links to other club-specific sections (e.g., Events, Members, Announcements).

   -------------------------------

   | Posts   | Events   | About  |
   -------------------------------
   | [Add New Post]              |

   -------------------------------

Additional Considerations:
- Responsive Design: Ensure all pages are fully responsive, adapting to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- User Authentication: Implement proper authentication mechanisms to handle login and signup securely (e.g., password hashing, token-based authentication).
- Access Control: Restrict access to certain pages (like the Club-Specific Posts page) based on user roles or permissions.
- Navigation Links: Add links in the header or sidebar to navigate between the Login, Signup, and Club-Specific Posts pages easily.

Backend Implementation:
1. User Authentication API: Implement endpoints for login, signup, and authentication checks.
2. Database Schema: Create tables for users, posts, and clubs to store relevant data.
3. Club Posts Retrieval: Develop backend logic to fetch posts related to a specific club based on user requests.
